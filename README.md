1.	About Project 
1.1.	This is small not adaptive, lengthy project
1.1.1.	Lengthy = development was carried out in free    days (they fell out randomly at completely different times)
1.2.	I did this project for extension of web development skills (lmao, my skills are too bad :D) 
2.	Flaws

“Bellow there will be unfinished details (screenshots from the template, that is what should have been, but this is not, reason why there is no specific detail will be in paragraph 2.1)”

•	Background and logo in header (later I’ll write why it’s in one section)

•	“/” after titles

2.1.	Reasons why these items are not available

2.1.1.	Background and logo in header

Due to my inattention, I didn’t initially see that background was smaller in height in the template. Cause of this, later it was not possible to put the logo


2.1.2.	“/” After titles

I initially forgot about them. And I’m too lazy to add them later :D


2.1.3.	JavaScript in “Gallery”
My skills are not enough to make a full-fledged gallery. I’d better leave it like this, but next project I try to analyze it in more detail in JavaScript


2.1.4.	Video as picture

Here it’s not my fault. There was no link to the video in the template, which is why I had to literally copy from the template.
I tried to found that video, but I couldn’t find it.


2.1.5.	Not done slider of photo

Here’s too is not my fault! Here in the template there was only one photo, where to get the rest and the captions for them - idk


3.	What’s next 

Actually idk. Now (25.04.23) I try to write mini game on Pygame

(I think it’s worst game what saw people :D)

If talk about web development I want to do something much better than this, Idk what exactly yet.

So I hope I can do something really good.

(full completed, adaptive projects without bugs and flaws)
